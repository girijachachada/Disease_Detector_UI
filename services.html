            <h3>Diagnosing and Recognising Diseases</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Our diagnostic service begins with the user recording audio of their cough or uploading an audio
               file directly through our user-friendly web interface. Upon submission, the audio data undergoes a 
               series of processing steps facilitated by our sophisticated backend system, powered by state-of-the-art 
               machine learning algorithms.</p>
            <p>Based on the CNN model's predictions, the diagnostic result is generated and presented to the user in a 
                clear and understandable format through our web interface. Users receive information about the likelihood 
                of each respiratory disease.</p>

                    <li>Asthma Diagnosis
                        <br>
                        <p>Our advanced diagnostic system can analyze cough sounds and other respiratory 
                           indicators to assist in the early detection of asthma. By leveraging deep learning 
                           algorithms, we can identify patterns and characteristics associated with asthma, aiding in timely 
                           intervention and management of this chronic respiratory condition.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Bronchitis Detection
                        <br>
                        <p>Using sophisticated machine learning models, we specialize in the detection of bronchitis through the analysis of 
                            cough sounds. Our system can accurately distinguish cough patterns indicative of bronchitis, 
                            enabling healthcare professionals to initiate appropriate treatment strategies promptly.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Pertussis Screening
                        <br>
                        <p>Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, can be challenging to diagnose accurately. Our diagnostic services 
                            utilize state-of-the-art neural network models to identify unique cough signatures associated with pertussis infection. 
                            Early detection is crucial in preventing the spread of this contagious respiratory illness.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Pneumonia Identification
                        <br>
                        <p>Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. 
                            Our comprehensive diagnostic system employs advanced audio processing techniques to analyze cough sounds and 
                            other clinical indicators, aiding in the accurate identification of pneumonia cases. 
                            Early diagnosis facilitates timely medical intervention and improves patient outcomes.</p>
